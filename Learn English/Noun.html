            <hr>

    		<p>Nouns are an important part of speech in English, probably second only to verbs. It is difficult to say much without using a noun.</p>

            <p>There are several different types of English nouns. It is often useful to recognize what type a noun is because different types sometimes have different rules. This helps you to use them correctly.</p>

            <p class="heading"> Types of Nouns </p>

            <p class="sub-heading"> Common Nouns and Proper Nouns </p>

            <p class="sub-heading"> Common Nouns </p>

            <p>Most nouns are common nouns. Common nouns refer to people, places and things in general like chair or dog. Any noun that is not a name is a common noun.</p>

            <p>Examples:  <i>teacher, car, music, danger, receipt</i></p>

            <ul>
                <li>1. Have you seen my <strong>dog?</strong></li>
                <li>2. The <strong>books</strong> are on your <strong>desk.</strong></li>
                <li>3. ...the <strong>pursuit</strong> of <strong>happiness.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p class="sub-heading"> Common Nouns </p>

            <p>Names of people, places or organizations are proper nouns. Your name is a proper noun. London is a proper noun. United Nations is a proper noun. </p>

            <p><b>Rule: Proper nouns always start with a capital letter.</b></p>
            <p>Examples: <i>Jane, Thailand, Sunday, James Bond, Einstein, Superman, Game of Thrones, Shakespeare</i></p>

            <ul>
                <li>1. Let me introduce you to <strong>Mary.</strong></li>
                <li>2. The capital of <strong>Italy</strong> is <strong>Rome.</strong></li>
                <li>3. He is the chairman of the <strong>British Broadcasting Corporation.</strong></li>
                <li>4. I was born in <strong>November.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Note: Adjectives that we make from proper nouns also usually start with a capital letter, for example <i>Shakespearian, Orwellian.</i></p>


            <p class="sub-heading"> Concrete Nouns and Abstract Nouns </p>

            <p class="sub-heading"> Concrete Nouns </p>

            <p>Concrete nouns are physical things that you can touch. </p>
            <p>Examples: <i>man, rice, head, car, furniture, mobile phone</i></p>

            <ul>
                <li>1. How many <strong>stars</strong> are there in the <strong>universe?</strong></li>
                <li>2. Have you met <strong>James Bond?</strong></li>
                <li>3. Pour the <strong>water</strong> down the <strong>drain.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p class="sub-heading"> Abstract Nouns </p>

            <p>Abstract nouns are the opposite of concrete nouns. They are things that you cannot touch. Abstract nouns are ideas, concepts and feelings. </p>
            <p>Examples: <i>happiness, courage, danger, truth</i></p>

            <ul>
                <li>1. He has a great<strong>strength</strong></li>
                <li>2. Who killed President Kennedy is a real <strong>mystery.</strong></li>
                <li>3. Sometimes it takes <strong>courage</strong> to tell the <strong>truth.</strong></li>
                <li>4. Their lives were full of <strong>sadness.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p class="sub-heading"> Countable Nouns and Uncountable Nouns </p>

            <p class="sub-heading"> Countable Nouns </p>
            <p>(also called <strong>count nouns</strong>)</p>

            <p>You can count countable nouns. Countable nouns have singular and plural forms.</p>
            <p>Examples: <i>ball, boy, cat, person</i></p>

            <ul>
                <li>1. I have only five <strong>dollars.</strong></li>
                <li>2. The Earth was formed 4.6 billion <strong>years</strong> ago.</li>
                <li>3. There are lots of <strong>people</strong> but we don't have a <strong>car.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p class="sub-heading"> Uncountable Nouns </p>
            <p>(also called <strong>mass nouns</strong>)</p>

            <p>You cannot count uncountable nouns. You need to use "measure words" to quantify them.</p>

            <p>Rule: We never use uncountable nouns with the indefinite article (a/an). Uncountable nouns are always singular.</p>

            <p>Examples: <i>water, happiness, cheese</i></p>

            <ul>
                <li>1. Have you got some <strong>money?</strong></li>
                <li>2. Air-conditioners use a lot of <strong>electricity.</strong></li>
                <li>3. Do you have any <strong>work</strong> for me to do?</li>
                <li>4. Many Asians eat <strong>rice.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p class="heading"> Collective Nouns </p>
            <p>A collective noun denotes a group of individuals.</p>
            <p>Examples: <i>class (group of students), pride (group of lions), crew (group of sailors)</i></p>

            <p>Rule: Collective nouns can be treated as singular or plural. More about this at rules of subject-verb agreement with collective nouns.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>1. His <strong>family</strong> live in different countries.</li>
                <li>2. An average <strong>family</strong> consists of four people.</li>
                <li>3. The new <strong>company</strong> is the result of a merger.</li>
                <li>4. The <strong>board of directors</strong> will meet tomorrow.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="heading"> Compound Nouns </p>
            <p>A compound noun is a noun that is made with two or more words. Most compound nouns are [noun + noun] or [adjective + noun]. Each compound noun acts as a single unit and can be modified by adjectives and other nouns.</p>

            <p>Compound nouns have three different forms:</p>

            <p>1. open or spaced - space between words <strong>(bus stop)</strong></p>
            <p>2. hyphenated - hyphen between words <strong>(mother-in-law)</strong></p>
            <p>3. closed or solid - no space or hyphen between words <strong>(football)</strong></p>

            <p>Examples: <i>cat food, blackboard, breakfast, full moon, washing machine, software</i></p>

            <p>1. Can we use the <strong>swimming pool?</strong></p>
            <p>2. They stop work at <strong>sunset.</strong></p>
            <p>3. Don't forget that <strong>check-out</strong> is at 12 noon.</p>

            <div class="box">
                <p><b>Note:</b> &nbsp; 

Note that all nouns are more than one type. For example, <strong>common nouns</strong> can be <strong>concrete nouns</strong> or <strong>abstract nouns.</strong> (The <strong>common noun</strong> <i>danger</i> is an <strong>abstract noun.</strong>)

And the same noun can change its type according to meaning. For example, the noun <i>light</i> can be <strong>uncountable</strong> (light in general) or <strong>countable</strong> (lamp).
