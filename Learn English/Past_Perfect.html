            <hr>
            <br>

            <p> The past perfect, also called the pluperfect, is a verb tense used to talk about actions that were completed before some point in the past.</p>

            <p>Example  &nbsp; &nbsp; We were shocked to discover that someone <strong>had graffitied</strong> “Tootles was here” on our front door. We were relieved that Tootles <strong>had used</strong> washable paint.</p>

            <p>The past perfect tense is for talking about something that happened before something else. Imagine waking up one morning and stepping outside to grab the newspaper. On your way back in, you notice a mysterious message scrawled across your front door: Tootles was here. When you’re telling this story to your friends later, how would you describe this moment? You might say something like:</p>

             <p><strong>Example</strong> :  &nbsp; I turned back to the house and saw that some someone named Tootles <strong>had defaced</strong> my front door!</p>

             <p class="sub-heading"> The Past Perfect Formula </p>
             <p>The formula for the past perfect tense is <strong>had + [past participle]</strong>. It doesn’t matter if the subject is singular or plural; the formula doesn’t change.</p>

             <p class="sub-heading"> The Past Perfect Formula </p>

             <div class="box">
                <p><b>Note:</b> &nbsp; Most often, the reason to write a verb in the past perfect tense is to show that it happened before other actions in the same sentence that are described by verbs in the simple past tense. Writing an entire paragraph with every verb in the past perfect tense is unusual. </p>

            <p class="sub-heading"> When Not to Use the Past Perfect </p>

            <p>Don’t use the past perfect when you’re not trying to convey some sequence of events. If your friends asked what you did after you discovered the graffiti, they would be confused if you said: </p>

            <p><strong>Example</strong> :  &nbsp; I <strong>had cleaned it</strong> off the door</p>
