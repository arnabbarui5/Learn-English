            <br>

            <p> The past continuous tense, also known as the past progressive tense, refers to a continuing action or state that was happening at some point in the past. The past continuous tense is formed by combining the past tense of to be (i.e., was/were) with the verb’s present participle (-ing word).</p>

            <p>There are many situations in which this verb tense might be used in a sentence. For example, it is often used to describe conditions that existed in the past.</p>

            <p><strong>Example</strong>  &nbsp; &nbsp; The sun <b>was shining</b> every day that summer.</p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>  &nbsp; &nbsp; As I spoke, the children <b>were laughing</b> at my cleverness.</p>

            <p>It can also be used to describe something that was happening continuously in the past when another action interrupted it.</p>

            <p><strong>Example</strong>  &nbsp; &nbsp; The audience <b>was applauding</b> until he fell off the stage.</p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>  &nbsp; &nbsp; I <b>was making</b> dinner when she arrived.</p>

            <p>The past continuous can shed light on what was happening at a precise time in the past.</p>

            <p><strong>Example</strong>  &nbsp; &nbsp; At 6 o’clock, I <b>was eating</b> dinner.</p>

            <p>It can also refer to a habitual action in the past.</p>

            <p><strong>Example</strong>  &nbsp; &nbsp; She <b>was talking</b> constantly in class in those days.</p>

            <div class="box">
                <p><b>Note:</b> &nbsp; One final caution: Though the irregularities are few, not every verb is suited to describing a continuous action. Certain verbs can’t be used in the past continuous tense. One common example is the verb to arrive.</p>   
            </div>

            <p><span class="incorrect">Incorrect</span>  &nbsp; &nbsp; At noon, he <b>was arriving</b>.</p>
            <p><span class="correct">Correct</span>  &nbsp; &nbsp; At noon, he <b>arrived</b> .</p>
