            <hr>
            <br>

            <p> The <strong>present continuous</strong> verb tense indicates that an action or condition is happening now, frequently, and may continue into the future. </p>

            <p>The Present Continuous Formula: to be <strong>[am, is, are] + verb [present participle]</strong> .</p>
            <br>

            <p>These examples show how the present perfect can describe something that occurred or was the state of things at an unspecified time in the past.</p>
            <br>

            <p><strong>Example</strong> &nbsp; Aunt Christine <strong>is warming</strong> up the car while Scott looks for his new leather coat. They <strong>are eating</strong> at Scott’s favorite restaurant today, Polly’s Pancake Dinner.</p>

            <p>Key words:  &nbsp;<strong>Verb, present participle, tense, dynamic verbs, stative verbs</strong></p>

            <p>The present continuous (present progressive) tense is a way to convey any action or condition that is happening right now, frequently, and may be ongoing. It adds energy and action to writing, and its effect helps readers understand when the action is happening. Imagine Aunt Christine has surprised her nephew Scott for his birthday and is going to take him out to his favorite restaurant, Polly’s Pancake Diner. If I wanted to tell the story after it happened, I’d use the past tense: </p>

            <p><span class="correct">Correct</span> &nbsp; They <strong>waited</strong> at the red light, and Scott <strong>worried</strong> they might miss their reservation. (Past tense)</p>

            <p class="sub-heading"> The Present Continuous Formula </p>
            <p> To form the present continuous, follow this formula: </p>

            <p> <strong>To Be [Am, Is, Are] + Verb [Present Participle] </strong> </p>

            <p class="sub-heading"> When to Use the Present Continuous Tense </p>
            <p>Use the present continuous tense with the appropriate “to be” verb and a <strong>dynamic</strong> verb. A <strong>dynamic</strong> verb shows action and/or process. For example</p>

            <p><strong>Example :</strong></p>
            <p>Scott’s little sister is arriving at the diner two hours late because her roller-derby team, Chicks Ahoy, won the national championships early today. As she is walking into Polly’s Pancake Diner, she is yelling goodbye to her friends outside, and Scott hopes she doesn’t cause a scene since she is always embarrassing him in public.</p>

            <p class="sub-heading"> When Not to Use the Present Continuous Tense </p>

            <p>Do not use the present continuous tense with stative verbs. Stative verbs show a state of being that does not show qualities of change. These verbs can stay in the simple present. For example</p>

            <p><span class="incorrect">Incorrect</span>  &nbsp; &nbsp; Aunt Christine <strong>is preferring</strong> the maple walnut pancakes over the banana peanut butter ones that Scott loves.</p>
            <p><span class="correct">Correct</span>  &nbsp; &nbsp; Aunt Christine <strong>prefers</strong> the maple walnut pancakes over the banana peanut butter ones that Scott loves.</p>

            <div class="box">
                <p><b>Note:</b> &nbsp; Here, the stative verb to prefer shows opinion, and therefore should not be conjugated into the present continuous. Stative verb categories include emotion (to love), possession (to belong), and thoughts (to recognize), and none of these should use the present continuous form.</p>
