            <p> The future continuous tense, sometimes also referred to as the future progressive tense, is a verb tense that indicates that something will occur in the future and continue for an expected length of time. It is formed using the construction will + be + the present participle (the root verb + -ing). </p>

            <p>The future continuous tense, sometimes also referred to as the future progressive tense, is a verb tense that indicates that something will occur in the future and continue for an expected length of time. It is formed using the construction will + be + the present participle (the root verb + -ing).</p>

            <p>Example  &nbsp; &nbsp; I <strong>will arrive</strong> at five o’clock.</p>

            <p> I will arrive is the simple future tense of the verb to arrive. You arrive once; beyond that, you can’t keep on arriving. However, once you get there, you may be doing something that goes on continuously, at least for a certain period of time. </p>

            <p>Example  &nbsp; &nbsp; At five o’clock, I <strong>will be meeting</strong> with the management about my raise.</p>

            <p> Will be meeting is the future continuous tense of the verb to meet. The construction will + be + the present participle meeting indicates that the meeting isn’t going to happen in an instant, all at once. It will have a duration. The will + be + present participle construction always indicates the future continuous tense. </p>

            <p>Example  &nbsp; &nbsp; Michael <strong>will be running</strong> a marathon this Saturday.</p>
            <p>Example  &nbsp; &nbsp; Eric <strong>will be competing</strong> against Michael in the race.</p>
            <p>Example  &nbsp; &nbsp; I <strong>will be watching</strong> Michael and Eric race.</p>

            <p class="sub-heading"> The Future Continuous Tense Is for Action Verbs Only </p>

            <p>It is important to note that the future continuous tense is only used with action verbs, because it is possible to do them for a duration. (Action verbs describe activities like running, thinking, and seeing. Stative verbs describe states of existence, like being, seeming, and knowing.) To use the will + be + present participle construction with a stative verb would sound very odd indeed.</p>
