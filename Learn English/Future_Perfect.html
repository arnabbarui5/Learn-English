            <hr>
            <br>

            <p> The <strong>future perfect</strong> is a verb tense used for actions that will be completed before some other point in the future. </p>

            <p>Example  &nbsp; &nbsp; The parade <strong>will have ended</strong> by the time Chester gets out of bed. At eight o’clock I <strong>will have left.</strong></p>

            <p> Key words: &nbsp; <strong>Verb, past participle, tense, preposition</strong> </p>

            <p> The future perfect tense is for talking about an action that will be completed between now and some point in the future. Imagine that your friend Linda asks you to take care of her cat for a few days while she goes on a trip. She wants you to come over today at noon so she can show you where to find the cat food and how to mash it up in the bowl just right so that Fluffy will deign to eat it. But you’re busy this afternoon, so you ask Linda if you can come at eight o’clock tonight instead.</p>


            <p class="sub-heading"> The Future Perfect Formula </p>

            <p> The formula for the future perfect tense is pretty simple: <strong>will have + [past participle].</strong> It doesn’t matter if the subject of your sentence is singular or plural. The formula doesn’t change. </p>

            <p>The formula for the simple future is <strong>will + [root form of verb].</strong></p>

            <p class="sub-heading"> When to Use the Future Perfect Tense </p>

            <p>Sometimes, you can use the future perfect tense and the simple future tense interchangeably. In these two sentences, there is no real difference in meaning because the word before makes the sequence of events clear: </p>

            <p>Example  &nbsp;<strong>Linda will leave before you get there. Linda will have left before you get there.</strong></p>

            <p> But without prepositions such as before or by the time that make the sequence of events clear, you need to use the future perfect to show what happened first.  </p>

            <p>Example  &nbsp;<strong>At eight o’clock Linda will leave. <strong>(This means that Linda will wait until 8 o’clock to leave.)</strong> At eight o’clock Linda will have left. <strong>(This means Linda will leave before 8 o’clock.)</strong></p>
